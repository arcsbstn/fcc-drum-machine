# Drum Machine

View the project [here](https://hungry-kowalevski-20f07c.netlify.app/).

My solution for the [Drum Machine](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-drum-machine) project under [freeCodeCamp's Front End Development Libraries course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/).

This solution uses HTML5, CSS3, and Bootsrap5 for the basic structure and styling. It also uses React to process button click/keystroke inputs and play the audio.
